3. Core Features & Functionality
3.1 Health Data Integration
Metrics Tracked:
Steps (primary metric)
Active Minutes (movement/exercise time)
Distance (miles/kilometers)
Data Sources:
Apple Health (iOS) - via HealthKit API
Google Fit (Android) - via Google Fit REST API
Data Sync Strategy:
Phase 1: Manual data entry via web interface
Phase 2: Automated sync via companion mobile app (.NET MAUI)
Daily background sync when mobile app is installed
On-demand sync button in mobile app
Data Privacy & Persistence:
Opt-in model: Users explicitly consent per challenge
All shared data persists indefinitely within the organization
